            <h2><b>What is this website?</b></h2>
            <b>This Website</b> is a platform wherein you are able to learn a few things about numerical systems whilst learning to calculate the numerical systems itselfthrough the 
            use of this website's very own Numerical Conversion Calculator, wherein you will calculate the given integers you have typed to itself Decimal, Binary, Octal and 
            Hexadecimal form. And with the help of the <a style="text-decoration: none; color: aqua;"href="table.html">"Number System Conversion Table"</a>, you will be given a 
            format as to how exactly the numbers work whilst also learning more about the <a style="text-decoration: none; color: aqua;"href="Numerical.html">"Numerical Sytems"</a> 
            itself. This platforms helps you expand a much broader but a simpler understanding of the concept of the Numerical Systems in our world as these are specifically very 
            convenient for upcoming learners and students who insist in pursuingthe technological aspect of today's modern technologies that make use of such Numerical Systems.

            <h2><b>Who made this website?</b></h2>
            This website was originally made by one IT student studying in the <b>University of Cebu Lapu-Lapu Mandaue</b> in the Philippines. He is <b>Ralph David F. Quiapo</b>, a 
            First Year BSIT(Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student who strives to be better at what he can do in the field of programming. Though the work itself put 
            through this website in itself may be quite minimal, Ralph is still     finding his way to become better at programming websites, software and so much more in the field that 
            needs more work put into it. This website itself started as a <b>Final Exam</b> type of test in the subject of Web Development wherein as you may guess by now, is to
            design a website of your own using the lessons that have been taught to you in the subject. Ralph himself has only planned so far to make a simple yet effective web design 
            wherein the goal is for everybody to learn the basics of Numerical Systems, the Table and to make use of the calculator itself.
